# Axios Mobile Excerise
Axios has a lot of award-winning journalism, and sometimes it doesn't all fit on one page, so we have to help readers easily find and read the stories they want. Your challenge is to build an interface for an app that displays various stories 

## Before you start
We're not trying to get you to work for us for free, so please don't spend than more than 4 hours on this. You can write a `TODO` doc that explains how you'd complete any tasks you don't get to.

## What You're Building
Using [The Movie Database’s](https://www.themoviedb.org) API, build a mobile app that lists popular movies.

The application should have the following features:

Lists the 20 most popular movies (first page of API results), in descending order, based on popularity.
Each movie includes a title, poster thumbnail, release date, and popularity metric.
The app does not need to persist favorites between launches, but should maintain favorites throughout navigation during a session.

## How to build it
We’d like you to use React Native but beyond that:

- Use whatever method of styling your app you prefer
- Use whatever flavor of JavaScript you like

We love open source, but please do not include any helper libraries for The Movie Database - we’re trying to understand how you work with APIs. Other libraries for data fetching, state management, routing etc. are just fine. However, you are not required to use any additional open source libraries if you don’t need or want them.

## API Details

You’ll be using version 3 of The Movie Database (TMDb) API to retrieve the data.
